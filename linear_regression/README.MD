# Linear Regression

In this example of Linear Regression, we use water quality data of various beaches, and predict the **height** of waves using other parameters like water **temperature**.

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.


# Requirements

Python 3 is required. Apart from that, a few `pip` packages are needed. The following command will install the required packages:
